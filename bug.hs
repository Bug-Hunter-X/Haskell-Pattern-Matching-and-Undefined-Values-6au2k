The following Haskell code attempts to use a pattern match on a list to check if the list is empty, but it contains a subtle error that leads to unexpected behavior:

```haskell
isEmpty :: [a] -> Bool
isEmpty [] = True
isEmpty (x:xs) = False

main :: IO ()
main = do
  print (isEmpty [])  -- Correctly prints True
  print (isEmpty [1,2,3]) -- Correctly prints False
  print (isEmpty undefined) -- Crashes with an exception!
```

The problem lies in the pattern matching.  When `isEmpty` receives `undefined`, the pattern matching fails to match either `[]` or `(x:xs)`.  This results in a runtime exception instead of a boolean result.  This behavior is more likely to manifest in more complex scenarios where undefined values might propagate unexpectedly.
